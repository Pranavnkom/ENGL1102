    <p id="stuff">Hello all, <br><br>

We have some good news. I’ve just been contacted by the British Prime Minister, and I have been told that Her Majesty’s Government has approved our request for an investigation into the recent deaths in the Aubrey family. All British law enforcement will now handover suspects and evidence related to the case to Europol. This is a remarkable achievement, given the tensions between Europol and the United Kingdom in the past year. Right now, we are trying to gain access to Emma Aubrey’s email account, as it may give us more information on potential enemies the Aubrey’s may have.
