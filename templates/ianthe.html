    <p id="stuff">On September 1st, 2018, Hellenic Police responded to a call from suburban Athens about screams coming from a neighboring apartment. The caller said these screams sent chills down her spine and made her blood curdle; she also said that she saw a bat flying out of an open apartment window not too long after the scream. When the police arrived to the crime scene, they found a body of a woman that covered in blood and had bite marks on the neck. The caller was brought into the apartment, and through further questioning, the police discovered that victim was a kind and friendly woman who did not have any enemies in these suburbs. This caller was shocked to see the sight and almost broke down in tears as she repeatedly said “...she had so much potential, a life of happiness with the love of her life ahead of her”. The police wished to inquire more about this “love of her life”, however the caller was in no position to continue speaking on the matter and she inconsolably went back to her home. The police then went back to the deceased woman’s body, and after further investigation, who was discovered to be Ianthe Afroudakis. Ianthe lived with her parents at the time of her death; Ianthe’s mother and father were both home at time of Ianthe’s death and are now being held by Hellenic Police under suspicion of committing the murder. Her parents grieved intensely as they were unable to get over the death of their only child, and the officers on the scene were said to be gossiping about the ethics of holding Ianthe’s parents under suspicion. What is most interesting about this case is that the forensic team in the Hellenic Police is unable to determine if the bite marks on the body’s neck are human in origin. A few members of the team hypothesized that the perpetrator had an animal with him or her, but no pet dander was found at the crime scene either. For these reasons, Hellenic Police is turning this case over to Europol along with all evidence and suspects.
