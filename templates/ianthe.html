    <p id="stuff">On September 1st, 2018, Hellenic Police responded to a call from suburban Athens about screams coming from a neighboring apartment.
    When the police arrived to the crime scene, they found a body of a woman that covered in blood and had bite marks on the neck.
    The deceased woman, after further investigation was discovered to be Ianthe Afroudakis. Ianthe lived with her parents at the time of her death.
    Ianthe’s mother and father were both home at time of Ianthe’s death and are now being held by Hellenic Police under suspicion of committing the murder.
    What is most interesting about this case is that the forensic team in the Hellenic Police is unable to determine if the bite marks on the body’s neck are human in origin.
    A few members of the team hypothesized that the perpetrator had an animal with him or her, but no pet dander was found at the crime scene either.
    For these reasons, Hellenic Police is turning this case over to Europol along with all evidence and suspects.</p>
