    <p id="stuff">On September 10th, 2018, Hellenic Police questioned William Aubrey, a British national visiting Volos, Greece. Earlier that day, when Mr. Aubrey and his friend, John Ruthven, were en route to Volos on Greek National Road 6, Mr. Aubrey claims that they stopped on the side of the highway due to a flat tire. According Mr. Aubrey’s story, they were then mugged by an armed individual who shot Mr. Ruthven after he attempted to resist. The individual fled, but was apprehended by two nearby officers. Mr. Aubrey claims that he laid Mr. Ruthven in the backseat of their vehicle while he tried to contact EMS, but that Mr. Ruthven died before EMS and police had arrived. Most of Mr. Aubrey’s account has been confirmed by security camera footage, but, interestingly, there was no corpse to be found after emergency services arrived on the scene. Security camera footage shows that Mr. Aubrey did not remove Mr. Ruthven’s body after placing him in the vehicle, so Mr. Aubrey has not been questioned further and has been allowed to return to the United Kingdom. However, Mr. Aubrey continues to be monitored by Europol, who have taken up the case after a request from the Hellenic Police.</p>
