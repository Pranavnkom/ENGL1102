    <p id="stuff">On September 10th, 2018, Hellenic Police questioned William Aubrey, a British national visiting Volos, Greece. Earlier that day, when Mr. Aubrey and his friend, John Ruthven, were en route to Volos on Greek National Road 6, Ruthven lost his life with Mr. Aubrey as a witness. He had no intentions of hiding his guilt or stress, but the police were in a hurry so they paid no attention to this and began questioning him immediately. Mr. Aubrey let the police know that he felt everything was going wrong in his life, as he lost his loved one a little more than a week ago to an unexpected and mysterious attack. Hellenic Police recognized that this matched up with the murder of Ianthe from September 1st, but they hesitated to hold him under suspicion as they wanted more details about the case at hand. Mr. Aubrey continued his story and claimed that they stopped on the side of the highway due to a flat tire. According to his story, they were then mugged by an armed individual who shot Mr. Ruthven in the shoulder after he attempted to resist. The police found it hard to believe that such a stoic man could be put down with one shot to the shoulder, and they began to increase their suspicions of Mr. Aubrey’s true nature. The individual who fired the shot fled, but was apprehended by two nearby officers, and is now residing in Volos City Jail. Mr. Aubrey claims that he laid Mr. Ruthven in the backseat of their vehicle while he tried to contact EMS, but that Mr. Ruthven died before EMS and police had arrived. Most of Mr. Aubrey’s account has been confirmed by security camera footage, but, interestingly, there was no corpse to be found after emergency services arrived on the scene. Security camera footage shows that Mr. Aubrey did not remove Mr. Ruthven’s body after placing him in the vehicle, so Mr. Aubrey has not been questioned further and has been allowed to return to the United Kingdom. However, Mr. Aubrey continues to be monitored by Europol, who have taken up the case after a request from the Hellenic Police. Europol has now linked this case to the murder of Ianthe from September 1st, and they continue to deduce how Mr. Aubrey, Ianthe, and John Ruthven are linked.
