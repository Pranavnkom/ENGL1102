    <p id="stuff">On the morning of September 11th, 2019, the London Ambulance Service received a call from East London about an unresponsive individual by the name of William Aubrey. Mr. Aubrey was taken to King’s College Hospital, where doctors later reported that he had dried from a stroke. Europol is interested in this incident because Mr. Aubrey was an individual who had been monitored by Europol for several months under suspicion that he was connected to the disappearance of the body of John Ruthven, who had died in a roadside shooting near Volos, Greece last year. Furthermore, this death comes just a day after the anniversary of John Ruthven’s death, which has led to more suspicion that there was foul play. Unfortunately, the political climate in the United Kingdom and its planned exit from the European Union has recently caused issues for Europol and the extent to which it can carry out its activities in British territory. Therefore, no investigation has been launched into this event.
