    <p id="stuff">On the morning of September 11th, 2019, the London Ambulance Service received a call from East London about an unresponsive individual by the name of William Aubrey. His guardians and the maids said that Mr. Aubrey had been having much trouble these past couple of days performing simple tasks, and that he was bedridden for much of everyday. They said it brought them great sadness to take care of “their dear William” as if he was a baby again, and this was not made any better by the fact that he did not even have the energy to respond to them. One night, he was found laying in his bed at home unattended; however, there was an expression of shock on his face that was uncharacteristic of a sleeping person. Mr. Aubrey was taken to King’s College Hospital, where doctors later reported that he had died from a stroke. His sister, Emma Aubrey, did not respond to this well, as he was the only family that she had left. She was devastated to know that he died in her presence, while she did nothing to check up on him during this ordeal. Europol is interested in this incident because Mr. Aubrey was an individual who had been monitored by Europol for several months under suspicion that he was connected to the disappearance of the body of John Ruthven, who had died in a roadside shooting near Volos, Greece last year, as well as being the suspected lover of Ianthe Afroudakis, who had died in an unexpected way in her apartment. Furthermore, this death comes just a day after the anniversary of John Ruthven’s death, which has led to more suspicion that this driven by factors outside of chance. Unfortunately, the political climate in the United Kingdom and its planned exit from the European Union has recently caused issues for Europol and the extent to which it can carry out its activities in British territory. Therefore, no investigation has been launched into this event.
