    <p id="stuff">In the last hours of September 11th, 2019, the Metropolitan Police responded to a call from East London about an alleged murder. When officers arrived on the scene, they discovered the body of Emma Aubrey. Mrs. Aubrey was discovered to be covered in blood and had bite marks on her neck. Forensic teams were unable to explain if a human or animal was the source of the bite marks. This case has unusually strong similarities to the 2018 murder of Ianthe Afroudakis because of the condition that the body was found in and the cause of death. This incident is of even greater interest to Europol because Emma Aubrey is the sister of William Aubrey, an individual that had both been monitored by Europol for sometime and had died earlier that day. Because of details of this incident and its importance to Europol, Europol is expected to try to take up this case from the Metropolitan Police. However, whether or not Europol will be successful or not in this endeavor is yet to be seen</p>
