    <p id="stuff">In the last hours of September 11th, 2019, the Metropolitan Police responded to a call from East London about an alleged murder. The police had arrived to this same house exactly twelve hours ago, and the guardians of Emma and William Aubrey looked absolutely devastated. They had looked like their vitality was leached from them, and they said this entire process had been a great shock to them. Ever since their daughter had been spending more time with that “tall man with a grey eye”, the guardians thought there was something off with William and with Emma’s relationship. They stated that they had not wished to intervene or meddle in Emma’s affairs, as they had no right to take care of a grown woman like that, but they still felt as if they were responsible for the deaths of their two beloved children. After this discussion with the guardians, the police went to Mrs. Aubrey’s bedroom, where they discovered her covered in blood with bite marks on her neck. Forensic teams were unable to explain if a human or animal was the source of the bite marks. This case has unusually strong similarities to the 2018 murder of Ianthe Afroudakis because of the condition that the body was found in and the cause of death. This incident is of even greater interest to Europol because Emma Aubrey is the sister of William Aubrey, an individual that had both been monitored by Europol for sometime and had died earlier that day. Because of details of this incident and its importance to national security, Europol is expected to try to take up this case from the Metropolitan Police.
